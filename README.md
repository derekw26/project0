# **TIC-TAC-TOE**

Welcome to the wonderful game of Tic-Tac-Toe created for Project #0.

Technologies used:
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- [Jquery library](https://jquery.com/)
- [CSS Gradient Animator](https://www.gradient-animator.com/)
- Google
- Rest of the internet

## Installation

Download the files into a folder and open "index.html" in a browser. Alternatively you can test it out [**here**](https://github.com/derekw26/project0).

## Methodology

I wanted to use images to represent the X and O on the board. I used Jquery selectors.

## Unsolved Problems

- Stacking the X and O Images on top of each other without using ```display: none```, and maintaining transitions
- A few other things to add

## Future Additions

- Rewrite Tic-Tac-Toe using React.js with extra features
- Include LocalStorage to save game state
- Create an AI that is unbeatable
- Spiff it up a bit, looking a little plain Jane
